# Distributed Verifiable Random Functions: an Enabler of Decentralized Random Beacons

This code repository provides  __a C++ implementation of three Distributed Verifiable Random Functions__  (DVRF) described in Fetch.AI's technical report [Fully Distributed Verifiable Random Functions and their Application to Decentralised Random Beacons](dvrfs-report.pdf) and named respectively GLOW-DVRF, DDH-DVRF and Dfinity-DVRF. A _Distributed Verifiable Random Function_ is a particular case of [secure multiparty computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) that allows a set of mutually distrustful servers to initialize and compute a [Verifiable Random Function](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05) *f<sub>sk</sub>(x)* for strings *x*, with no trusted central party. A Verifiable Random Function  can be seen as the public-key cryptography version of a keyed cryptographic hash. A prominent application for such protocols is in PoS-based consensus in distributed ledgers which require a reliable, unpredictable and unbiased source of entropy or [Decentralized](https://blog.cloudflare.com/league-of-entropy/) [Random Beacon](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons) (DRB) to select block producers.

### Summary :star: <a name="summary"></a>

This code base implements two new DVRF (and DRB) designs named __GLOW-DVRF__ (and GLOW-DRB) and __DDH-DVRF__ (DDH-DRB), whose high-level specification can be found in the [technical report](dvrfs-report.pdf) [[1]](#1). GLOW-DVRF uses [Pairing-Based Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing-based_cryptography), while DDH-DVRF uses standand [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography). This code also implements the pairing-based __Dfinity-DVRF__ (and Dfinity-DRB) outlined in [[2]](#2).

The [report](dvrfs-report.pdf) defines two security properties for DVRFs, named standard and strong pseudorandomness. It is shown that both new designs __GLOW-DVRF__ and __DDH-DVRF__ meet __strong pseudorandomness__, while Dfinity-DVRF meets standard pseudorandomness. Furthermore, our experiments show that both GLOW-DVRF and DDH-VRF __outperform__ Dfinity-DVRF __in running time__ (for details take a look at the figures shown next and the [report](dvrfs-report.pdf)).

### Getting Started :hammer_and_pick: <a name="getting-started"></a>

This project is built using CMake and requires the following dependences
* GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)  
* Protocol Buffer
* OpenSSL 
* Libsodium 
* POSIX Threads
* pkg-config

#### On Ubuntu :penguin:

#### On Ubuntu 19.10

Update and install dependencies

```bash 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake libgmp-dev libssl-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev pkg-config libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libsodium-dev
```

#### On Ubuntu 18.04

Update and install dependencies

```bash 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake libgmp-dev libssl-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev pkg-config 
```

To obtain the latest versions of the other dependencies please follow the instructions for [Libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation/#compilation-on-unix-like-systems) and [Protocol Buffer](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md).

#### On Mac :apple:
Install brew and then dependencies
```bash 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install cmake gmp protobuf openssl libsodium pkg-config
```

#### Building the Project 
Once all dependences have been installed clone the repository and initialise submodules
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fetchai/research-dvrf.git
cd research-dvrf
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Build the project
```bash 
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
For Mac users, problems with finding OpenSSL might be remedied by specifying the root directory path to cmake. This can be done by replacing `cmake ..` with
```bash 
cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/[version]/ ..
```

Run tests (from build directory)
```bash
./lib/test/consensusTest
```

Note, the network nodes on the benchmarks described below run on local host with port numbers starting at 1024.


### Benchmarks :factory: <a name="benchmarks"></a>

#### PartialEval and Combine Functions
The two functions, **PartialEval** and **Combine**, used in generating each randomness value can be benchmarked for all implementations using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). To do this, run the following command from the root directory 
```bash
bash scripts/benchmark_functions.sh
```
which will prompt for the name of the file to write the benchmarks to. This runs the pairing-based protocols with the curves in order BN256, BLS12-381, and BN384.

To select a particular implementation out of `[dfinity]`, `[glow]` and `[ddh]` run, for example,
```bash
./lib/benchmarks/consensusBenchmarks "[dfinity]"
```
Similarly, a specific benchmark can be run by replacing `[dfinity]` with the name of the benchmark. The function **Combine** is dependent on N, and is bencharked for N = 50, 100, and 200 with threshold N/2 + 1. Average times for computing a single random value is then obtained by combining the benchmarks for **PartialEval** and **Combine**.  


#### Random Beacon
This app benchmarks the decentralised random beacon for local or network nodes for a chosen number of rounds. The benchmarking app for the decentralised random beacon circumvents the DKG step by distributed pre-comuted keys to all nodes allowing faster benchmarking of the DRB for a large number of nodes. The app outputs the following benchmarks:
1. Total time: time for all nodes to complete a fixed number of random beacon rounds
2. Average unite time/round: time for a node to complete one round of the random beacon

Example with N = 15 local nodes with zero latency, threshold T = 8 and r = 10 rounds
```bash
./apps/benchmark_threshold_signing/BenchmarkThresholdSigning -N 15 -T 8 -r 10
```

To view the app options and default parameters
```bash
./apps/benchmark_threshold_signing/BenchmarkThresholdSigning --help
```

### Randomness Generation :slot_machine: <a name="randomness-generation"></a>
To generate a series of random values using the available implementations run, from the build directory, the random beacon app for the required number of rounds
```bash
./apps/random_beacon/RandomBeacon -r 10
```

![](img/random-beacon.gif)

The random value is obtained by computing the SHA512 hash of the group signature and is displayed in hexadecimal format. This app bypasses the DKG using a trusted dealer, and can therefore start the generation of random values for a large number of participants quickly. By default, the mcl implementation of the GLOW-DVRF, with curve BN256 and 10 local nodes, is run. To view the other default values and command line interface to change them use `--help`.

Further implementation details are available [here](implementation-details.md).
